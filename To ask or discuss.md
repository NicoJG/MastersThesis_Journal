## Introduction

- Ask Oskar why he thinks the mono-energetic beam approximation is the major reason we see the reversed pellet rocket effect. I avoided talking about this because I am not so sure about it and cannot reason this at all.
- Discuss with Oskar (and Istvan) is "spreading" the field lines that hit the pellet surface over the whole neutral cloud is accurately displaying our approximations
- Ask how I can quote SciPy in section 4.2.2
