## Introduction

- Ask Oskar why he thinks the mono-energetic beam approximation is the major reason we see the reversed pellet rocket effect. I avoided talking about this because I am not so sure about it and cannot reason this at all.
- Discuss with Oskar (and Istvan) is "spreading" the field lines that hit the pellet surface over the whole neutral cloud is accurately displaying our approximations
- Discuss with Oskar the sentence in plasmoid shielding "It is unclear whether this represents physical reality or results from the approximation of electrons passing through the plasmoid unaffected."
- Check the densities in the plasmoid shielding chapter together with Oskar
- Discuss with Oskar Sarah's comment about Samulyaks simulations being more sophisticated
- Introduction of chapter 4: towards less heated side -> towards low pressure side
- Ask how I can quote SciPy in section 4.2.2
