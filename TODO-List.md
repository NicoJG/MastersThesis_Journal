## important

## final polishing before submission

## optional

- no - include "Nomenclature" section in the frontmatter?
- maybe - make the illustration for the radial path approximation better
- maybe - explain the rocket nozzle correspondence with an illustration
- no - show how well the boundary conditions are met for both the 0th and 1st order in the appendix
- no - talk about the E<20eV limitation in the appendix
- no - maybe show p_0 plot in the appendix
- no - could compare the shielding length formula with Senichenkovs formula
- no - Oskar: Maybe it could be helpfull to add three more rows in the table with dT/dz = 10 keV/m, as this shows both a better agreement with the average experimental value and the Samulyaks scaling with the pellet radius. Even if you state these things in the text, the information displayed in the table might get quite a lot more attention, and a lazy reader might otherwise jump to the conclusion that e.g. the scaling in your model is wrong, which is perhaps not the impression you want to give. But only if it is not too much work, it is fine with me to just have it in the text as well.
