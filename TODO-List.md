## important

- ask Tünde about the final submission deadline
- properly cite SciPy!
- change the title page image
	- adjust the cover page image description on page iv
- write the Acknowledgements
- make stuff in the appendix readable or remove unnecessary stuff
- check the densities together with Oskar

## final polishing before submission

- check the bibliography
	- make volume numbers in bibliography bold instead of italic
	- should the bibliography really list all authors?
- check equation punctuation
- make equations that are not referenced to equation*
- handle all the LaTeX warnings
- check if the acronyms are accurate
- check if the pages in the frontmatter and backmatter are correct, i.e. correct cleardoublepage and newpage


## optional

- In the results list also qrel, Erel, plasmoid acc, ... in a table, maybe mention that delta r comes into play linearly
- make page after List of Acronyms to have the correct headline
- include "Nomenclature" section in the frontmatter?
- make the illustration for the radial path approximation better
- explain the rocket nozzle correspondence with an illustration
- make a better fit of b
- mention mistakes in the pstar and Tstar formulas in the appendix
- maybe show how well the boundary conditions are met for both the 0th and 1st order in the appendix
- talk about the E<20eV limitation in the appendix
- maybe show p_0 plot in the appendix
- could compare the shielding length formula with Senichenkovs formula
- understand where the ideal gas fluid equations come from (Landau Lifschitz for energy balance)
	- optionally: write the subsubsection on the ideal gas fluid dynamics
- Oskar: Maybe it could be helpfull to add three more rows in the table with dT/dz = 10 keV/m, as this shows both a better agreement with the average experimental value and the Samulyaks scaling with the pellet radius. Even if you state these things in the text, the information displayed in the table might get quite a lot more attention, and a lazy reader might otherwise jump to the conclusion that e.g. the scaling in your model is wrong, which is perhaps not the impression you want to give. But only if it is not too much work, it is fine with me to just have it in the text as well.
