- properly cite SciPy!
- Make plots with LaTeX
- Inplot legend for the solutions
- change the title page image
- write the Acknowledgements
- write the acronyms and nomenclature
- make stuff in the appendix readable or remove unnecessary stuff

## final polishing before handing it in

- check the bibliography
	- make volume numbers in bibliography bold instead of italic
	- should the bibliography really list all authors?
- check equation punctuation
- make equations that are not referenced to equation*
- handle all the LaTeX warnings


## optional
- explain the rocket nozzle correspondence with an illustration
- make a better fit of b
- mention mistakes in the pstar and Tstar formulas in the appendix
- maybe show how well the boundary conditions are met for both the 0th and 1st order in the appendix
- talk about the E<20eV limitation in the appendix
- maybe show p_0 plot in the appendix
- could compare the shielding length formula with Senichenkovs formula
- understand where the ideal gas fluid equations come from (Landau Lifschitz for energy balance)
	- optionally: write the subsubsection on the ideal gas fluid dynamics
