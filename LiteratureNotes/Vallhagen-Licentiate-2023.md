# Chapter 3

- ablated and ionized material starts to homogenize + pressure and temperature equilibrate
- excess pressure drives expansion along B-field at plasmoid sound speed
- there is an electric field gradient along minor radius, due to higher electron mobility, colder temperature and higher density -> drift in poloidal direction
- conservation of momentum -> plasma poloidal rotation opposite to drift
- poloidal stretching of the ablated material (reason not super clear?)
- collisions and small scale turbulence eventually completes homogenization
- charge separation due to $\nabla B$ leads to drift towards low field side (cross-field drift) 
    - is this what causes the bending of the ionized part?
    - pressure in cloud decreases -> decreasing charge separation -> decreasing drift
    - once long enough to reach around poloidally -> charge separation smaller (same as tokamak twisting principle) -> stops drift
    - additional currents counteracting the charge separation (also has 3 components: polarization drift, Alfven wave driven current and Alfven waves interfering creating ohmic current)
