# Introduction

- pellet injection is used both for fuelling and controlling
- both in core and edge physics
- transient improvement of the confinement allows higher density in both H- and L-mode operation
    - high-/low-confinement mode, in low-confinement the temperature profile is smooth, in high-confinement its sharp at the edge
- fuelling efficiency (proportion of mass deposited in plasma) better the higher the pellet penetration
- "Correlatively, the matter deposition profile (i.e. the increment of plasma density) was observed to be significantly shifted in the direction of the major radius with respect to the ablation profile [2, 4, 5]."?
	- matter deposition profile: where the matter ends up after taking into account all dynamics
    - ablation profile: how does the pellet ablate (basically if there is no EM-field)
- Gives list of more reviews on the physics of pellet injection
- "Among the different phenomena invoked to explain the pellet self-shielding, the dissipation of the energy carried by the plasma electrons (and ions) in the cold and dense neutral cloud surrounding the pellet was shown to be dominant...[NGS]" -> heating is involved in the self-shielding?
    - shielding here means from the energy input of incoming electrons to the pellet (ions play smaller role)
    - in the neutral cloud atoms get excited and emit radiation (main shielding mechanism)
- Other shielding mechanisms:  ionized part of the ablation cloud/plasma shielding?, charge of the ablation cloud with respect to the background plasma/electrostatic shielding?
    - in ionized part the electrons scatter around and dissipate energy
    - ionized part is slightly negatively charged (electrons are held back by ions) and repels incoming electrons
- Focus of this review: current profile change for deep penetration and "prompt mass loss" for medium penetration ?
    - "prompt mass loss" just means pellet mass that is expelled from the plasma
- pellet injection is used to trigger ITBs (internal  transport barriers)
- high field injection is considered because of "outward displacement of the matter deposition profile" due to "drift of the pellet material down the magnetic field gradient" (rocket effect?)
- but high field injection: "geometry of the guide tube is complicated and the stress experienced by the pellet in the curved sections limits the maximum injection velocity."

# Chapter 2

- ablation cloud characteristics first measured 1980s
- pellet ablates very quickly and after 5-10 ms the temperature in the neutral cloud (cigar shaped) is 20-25 eV with density around $10^{23}$ $m^{-3}$
- ablation rate not measured -> hard to construct machine independent models
- IPADBASE (International Pellet Ablation Data Base) includes measurements on the pellet penetration/ablation in several tokamaks, with wide range of parameters
- ablation seems to be the same in stellerators, but enhanced in Reversed Field Pinches (RFP)
- NGS model good for moderate power injected (what does "injected power"?)
    - injected power probably just refers to the power injected into the pellet or maybe injected heating power into the plasma 
- high injected power -> localized over ablation -> fuelling efficiency decreases (why? less penetration depth)
- 2.1.3 is about pellet trajectory observations
- deflection observed in toroidal and/or poloidal direction due to rocket effect (I thought radial direction?)
- imbalance in electron or ion distribution -> asymmetrical ablation profile -> rocket effect
- "In ohmic plasmas, the asymmetry is due to the distortion of the electron distribution function by the parallel electric field" (isn't it always ohmic, i.e. a current heats it up?)  
- from deflection the electron density or current profile can be calculated
- "At low density, the origin of the unbalance of ablation can be the increase in the population of runaways consecutively to the injection of a previous pellet" ?
- case of high additional power -> asymmetry from high energy ion tail ?
- 2.2 Ablation models
- ablation is self-regulated <-> ablation cloud self-adapts to regulate the heat flux onto the pellet through shielding (with line integrated density)
- 3 important shielding mechanisms
    - magnetic shielding <-> partial expulsion of magnetic field, reduced incident flux, potentially important in future reactors due to higher diamagnetism
    - electrostatic shielding <-> ionized part of ablation cloud is slightly negatively charged, repels electrons
    - neutral gas shielding/plasma shielding <-> collisions of incident particles with cloud, ionizing and heating the ablatant (cloud)
        - low-sublimation energy ($10^{-2}$ eV/mol) of hydrogen leads to almost 100% neutral gas/plasma shielding (impurity pellets have high sublimation energy ~7.5 eV/atom, lower shielding) ?
        \4 the ablation cloud is larger for low-sublimation energy because material is more easily ejected
- Neutral Gas Shielding (NGS) model by Parks 1978
    - spherically symmetric ablation cloud expansion
    - electronic Maxwell distribution replaced by a single velocity/energy (beam)
    - pellet radius shrinking speed scales as $r_\text{pellet}^{-2/3} n_\text{plasma}^{1/3} T_\text{plasma}^{1.64}$
    - confirmed by model including dissosiation, ionization, radiation-loss
    - similar models for impurity pellets
- newer models exist taking into account ionized cloud geometry, incident distribution function
    - MacAulay: anisotropic cloud and incident heat flux, spherical pellet, average ablation rate
    - Kuteev: lentil shaped pellet (higher ablation perpendicular to B-field), spherical cloud expanding at sonic speed, optional negative charge of cloud
    - Parks et al: influence of magnetic field -> high heat flux can lead to fluidized flat pellet, more surface area, up to 3 times shorter ablation time
    - all agree with NGS and that anisotropic heating reduces ablation rate by factor of 2
    - taking into account electron Maxwellian distribution increases ablation rate by factor 3 to 5 (included in above models)
- high-energy particles from heating taken into account in 2 models (Pegourie and Kuteev) -> faster ablation
- hot ions don't contribute, only if "orbit characteristics are such that they can penetrate the cloud by its lateral face and reach the pellet" ?
    - ion orbits larger than the ablation cloud lead to injection on the perpendicular direction
- fusion born $\alpha$-particles are expected to not play a large role
- "role of the atomic physics processes"? reduces ablation rate by ~30\% (connected to shock fronts "upstream and downstream the ionization front"?)
    - atomic physics refers to ionization, radiation or dissociation due to electron collisions
- the ionized part of the ablation cloud expanding along the B-field lines but perpendicular the expansion is stopped
    - the ablatant follows the pellet as long as it is neutral
    - the Lorentz force $\vec{F}_L = e \cdot (\vec{v}_\text{pellet} + \vec{v}_\text{expansion}) \times \vec{B}$ is split into $F_\text{expansion}$ and $F_\text{pellet}$
    - leads to elongation parallel to $\vec{B}$ through the parallel parts
    - the drift $\vec{v}_\text{expansion,drift} = -\frac{\vec{F}_\text{expansion} \times \vec{B}}{eB^2} = -\vec{v}_\text{expansion}$ stops the expansion perpendicular to $\vec{B}$
    - the drift associated to $F_\text{pellet}$ stops it following the pellet (Chapter 3)
    - general shape complicated, important parameter to be modeled is $z_0$ the elongation along $\vec{B}$
    - "Although these two determinations of z0 can be significantly different, the penetrations calculated by the two models for Maxwellian plasmas are almost identical, demonstrating that the additional shielding due to the ionized part of the cloud does not play a crucial role in the determination of the ablation rate." wrong?
    - multiple models for $r_0$ and $z_0$
    - "warm-up-time" plays a role for $r_0$
    - in reactor grade conditions lower ablation rate expected
    - unclear if transverse deceleration has a shock-front or not
- ablation cloud has electric potential, when taken into account, ablation rate changes by factor $~2$ (single-sheath/double-sheath?)
- steady state approximation was validated as long as inhomogeneous pressure is too weak to flatten pellet
- multiple models exist for impurity pellets that go beyond NGS
- overall, the success of NGS is puzzling, because it doesn't take into account many important dynamics (potentially all dynamics cancel each other)
- geometry of the ionized part of the cloud does not seem to be important for the ablation rate, plasma shielding seems not very important (this paragraph might be good to look at later again starts with "More surprising is the fact that the change in the cloud expansion geometry...")
    - the asymmetry in the parallel direction is not important
    - plasma shielding still leads to an asymmetric heat flow into the pellet (rocket effect) in the perpendicular direction but the total ablation rate is probably not affected by this
    - this is purely from physics models and reasoning, measuring this is not really possible because we can only measure the penetration depth
- NGS model good for ablation rate but not sufficient for ablation cloud characteristics
- extrapolation to reactor grade conditions is unclear, models ablation rate range from factors 1/3 to 3 times the NGS rate
- DT-pellets could have different dynamics than $D_2$ or $H_2$ (?) pellets
    - $D_2$ is deuterium (1p+1n), $H_2$ is a hydrogen molecule (2p) which is naturally formed when cooling hydrogen


- measurements:
	- neutral cloud density: 1e25-1e26 m^-3
	- plasmoid density: 1e23-1e24 m^-3
	- temperature 1-4 eV
	- beginning of homogenization (after 5-10 musec) 20-25 eV in plasmoid
	- constant temperature in plasmoid for around 4 cm
	- ablation rate nearly impossible to measure directly
	- NGS scaling is accurate for moderate injected power

# Chapter 3

- several different dynamics contribute to the pellet material being spread over the whole plasma inside the tokamak (or stellerator)
- initially parallel expansion along field lines with measured velocity of $10^5$ m/s then slows down, sometimes longer than one turn around the tokoamak
- whole homogenization process lasts less than 1 ms
- in stellerator LHD, homogenization found to be globally adiabatic
- The pellet injection modifies the electric potential in the plasma
    - edge was observed to become more negative
    - "and the corresponding modification of the plasma rotation is consistent with the poloidal deformation of the ablation cloud observed on the same machine" ?
        \4 poloidal plasma rotation <-> opposite poloidal ablation cloud rotation
    - electric potential sign dependent on which side of the equatorial plane the pellet is injected -> linked to vertical drifts
- ablated material drifts towards low field side
    - experimentally observed by difference in calculated and measured post-injection density profile, which is shifted more outwards than expected
    - also through comparing low- and high-field-side injection, where in HFS injection the matter is deposited more outwards than the maximum pellet penetration depth
    - how can we measure pellet penetration depth independent of density profile? (optical fibers?)
    - drift velocity $~10^4$ m/s
    - measured magnitude of outward displacement compared to ablation profile is low, however better penetration from HFS observed (contradictory?)
- "Another consequence of the presence of such a drift is the acceleration of the pellet in the direction of the plasma major radius..." briefly talks about rocket effect
    - outward acceleration $~5\cdot 10^5$ m/$s^2$
    - attributed to either rocket effect or "drag force between the drifting material and the pellet surrounded by its neutral cloud" ?
- in stellerators the same outward drift exists but is harder to interpret and measure because magnetic field changes over smaller scales and is more complicated
- in W7-AS a low-velocity inward drift was observed, potentially drag of inward flowing plasma
- models:
- 3 models for parallel expansion
    - Parks 1D model is a "Lagrangian model"? -> pressure equilibration ~100$\mu s$ much faster than temperature equilibration
    - Rozhansky 1D model -> supersonic expansion forms shock front, in reactor grade conditions cloud cold for longer
    - Pegourie 0D model -> includes plasma viscosity -> first supersonic then subsonic
- the potential perturbation might be due to faster temperature equilibration than density equilibration -> electrons leave cloud faster -> cloud slightly positive and plasma slightly negative
- but dependence on equatorial plane is unclear -> radial electric field -> change in poloidal rotation
- $\nabla B$-induced drifts leads to drift along the gradient
    - $\nabla B$ and $p_\text{cloud} > p_\text{plasma}$ leads to vertical charge separation, but is canceled partly in open circuit conditions ?
    - change in resulting vertical E-field under current closure -> acceleration in radial direction
    - drift stops at pressure equilibrium
    - drift reversible to equilibrium for localized density perturbation from LFS, but large perturbations at HFS drives reconnection
    - instabilities are easier to excite on LFS, because pressure adds to background pressure drive
    - instabilities can also lead to fragmented clouds
- fuelling scenario simulated -> narrower deposition profile than measured
- ITER projections: larger displacements for "reversed shear configurations"?
- models taking cloud expansion and drift into account -> charge separation current compensation + Alfven wave emissions important and opposite 
    - the models are quite complex and I didn't understand most of it, but all of the are unclear how well they agree with data
- all effect due to winding magnetic field
- interaction between $\nabla B$ drift and poloidal rotation perturbation is not well studied
