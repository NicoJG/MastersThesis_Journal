My workflow for taking notes combines the Markdown note-taking tool [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) with the PDF/Reference Manager [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/).
The key link between the two is the plugin-collection [ZotLit](https://zotlit.aidenlx.top/), which makes it easy to insert deep links to specific annotations or pages of PDFs that are stored in my Zotero library.
