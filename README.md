# Master's Thesis Journal
All the notes for my master's thesis on the Pellet Rocket Effect in magnetic confinement fusion at the Plasma Theory group at Chalmers, Sweden in 2024.

My workflow for taking notes combines the Markdown note-taking tool [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) with the PDF/Reference Manager [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/).
The key link between the two is the plugin-collection [ZotLit](https://zotlit.aidenlx.top/), which makes it easy to insert deep links to specific annotations or pages of PDFs that are stored in my Zotero library.
